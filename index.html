<p class="citation"><em>"I recommend this place 100%.  I especially liked the privacy, hot tub, and purified water, how cozy, clean and organized the home is, having my own refrigerator and coffee maker, and the quiet and natural environment around the home.  Jan is a very nice person, very friendly and easy to get along with.  She helped me in many different ways and was always respectful of my privacy.  The hot tub at night and the walks outside in parks and around the lakes are amazing!  </em>--  Myriam Lopez, Physical Therapist and Rolfing Student, from Cali, Colombia </p>

<p class="citation"><em>"This place wants for nothing! The room is very homelike, as well as the rest of the house and it is nice to have an own bathroom. You can feel free to use the living-room and the kitchen every time. Jan is a very warmhearted woman. Thus it felt like home very quickly. The kitties are such cuties! I enjoyed my time in Boulder every day of my three month stay! Can't wait for my next visit!"</em> - Silvia Hoffman, Meteorologist Masters Candidate, from Germany</p>
         
<p class="citation"><em>"I lived in Jan's room for 6 months and it was wonderful! The place is very quiet; it is perfect for relaxing and/or working at home. Everything is in good condition, with total privacy. Jan is friendly, sweet and peaceful.  These things make all the difference.  I am sure my time in the US was better because I stayed in her house.  I strongly recommend her room."</em>  - Vania Andrioli, Scientist, PhD Candidate, from Brazil</p>

<p class="citation"><em>"The room is very comfortable, well-suited if one needs to use kitchen, laundry, etc. without having to buy things. The house is neat, and I found everything to my liking.  Jan is a wonderful person and hostess and makes one feel at home.  Cats are darlings one can adore.  I would love to be here again given another trip.  Thank you so much."</em>  -- Pratibha Kudva, Executive, from India </p>

<p class="citation"><em>"I'm really happy I decided to rent a room from Jan during my year of schooling at BCMT!  Jan provided more than a comfortable, safe, and nurturing space for me to eat, sleep, and study.  She provided me a supportive, energetic space to personally grow and explore new ideas and practices, especially in the area of health and wellness.  With humor and great communication skills, Jan went to great lengths to facilitate a mutually satisfying experience for us both.  My year at BCMT was highly successful and the bonus was gaining a life long friend in Jan." </em>--  Julia Schloesser, Certified Massage Therapist, from Colorado Springs </p>
